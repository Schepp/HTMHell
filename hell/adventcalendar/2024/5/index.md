Are you aware of [Forced Colors Mode](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/09/17/styling-for-windows-high-contrast-with-new-standards-for-forced-colors/)? If not, there are some [resources](#resources) at the end. If so, did you also know that this accessibility feature can be used as an entry-level debugging tool?

<figure><img src="htmhell-goes-fcm.webp" alt="Comparing HTMHell.dev: Three screenshots taken in Microsoft Edge browser. Although subtle tweaks could be made, overall the site works really well in Forced Colors Mode.">

<p class="highlight" data-icon="‚ÑπÔ∏è"><strong>Note:</strong> I‚Äôve created a <a href="https://codepen.io/cssence/pen/BaXMNyv">CodePen with all the upcoming examples,</a> so you can follow along.</p>

## Premise

When the forced colors feature is turned on, colors will be replaced with [CSS System Colors](https://adrianroselli.com/2021/02/whcm-and-system-colors.html#CSS4). Elements like buttons and links get special colors assigned, so wherever improper elements are used, things will fall out of place.

## Bad advice

Okay, surely there‚Äôs a way around this, in true HTMHell.dev spirit‚ÄΩ

<p class="highlight" data-icon="‚ö†Ô∏è"><strong>Warning:</strong> Sarcasm ahead! <em>Don‚Äôt try this at home!</em></p>

Let‚Äôs use a `<div>` to create a button, and `<u>` to create a link. By doing the latter, our links are already underlined, but we avoid this pesky menu on right-click that feels out of place in our carefully crafted user interface.<sup><a id="ref-fn-1" href="#fn-1" role="doc-noteref" aria-label="Footnote #1">[1]</a></sup>

```html
<div class="button">‚ÄúButton‚Äù</div>
<u data-href="https://example.com/very-bad">‚ÄúLink‚Äù</u>
```

Thanks to the `data-href` on the link we know where to go. And yes, this means a little JavaScript will be needed to actually go there. Most likely we anyhow have a Single Page Application, so we‚Äôll stay put.

Now all that is left to be done is style our buttons and add color to our links.<sup><a id="ref-fn-2" href="#fn-2" role="doc-noteref" aria-label="Footnote #2">[2]</a></sup>

```css
.button {
  border: .125rem solid; /* etc. */
}
u {
  color: light-dark(oklch(0.43 0.3 264.05), oklch(0.69 0.17 281.16));
}
```

All good? Sadly no, I‚Äôm sure the accessibility police will soon be all over the place.

Fine, let‚Äôs make our elements interactive. For brevity, I‚Äôm not gonna talk about all the JavaScript required, but rest assured to make things accessible we‚Äôll need a metric fuckton of it.<sup><a id="ref-fn-3" href="#fn-3" role="doc-noteref" aria-label="Footnote #3">[3]</a></sup>

To fix the HTML, I asked artifical ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù, and several prompts later I learned that we need to sprinkle some ARIA roles and tabindexes on top.

```html
<div role="button" tabindex="0" class="button">‚ÄúButton‚Äù</div>
<u role="link" tabindex="0" data-href="https://example.com/bad">‚ÄúLink‚Äù</u>
```

We‚Äôre good? Again, no, this is where **Forced Colors Mode** comes in. [No amount of ARIA](https://htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2022/2/) turns our elements into their semantic counterparts. As such, they all will be displayed in plain CanvasText color.

Alright, let‚Äôs manually add those colors, but inside a media query, so they won‚Äôt leak into our regular theme.

```css
@media (forced-colors: active) {
  .button {
    color: ButtonText;
    background-color: ButtonFace;
  }
  u {
    color: LinkText;
  }
}
```

I was about to ask ‚ÄúIs this it?‚Äù, but I just realized we need a database to keep track of all the links that have already been clicked, so we can visually indicate them as `.visited`, ... ‚Äî I‚Äôm gonna stop myself right there.

## Good advice

Enough of the Sisyphean labor. Let‚Äôs do the following instead.

```html
<button type="button">Button</button>
<a href="https://example.com/good">Link</a>
```

For styling, all you have to do is inherit the font for buttons, which is what your [CSS reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/#six-inherit-fonts-for-form-controls-7) might do anyhow for all form controls.

In Forced Colors Mode, things just work, buttons and links will be shown in proper CSS system colors. **Semantics for the win!**<sup><a id="ref-fn-4" href="#fn-4" role="doc-noteref" aria-label="Footnote #4">[4]</a></sup>

<figure><img src="a-div-is-not-a-button-even-in-fcm.webp" alt="While we eventually can make our fake elements look like the real deal even in Forced Colors Mode, we should avoid all that work and use proper elements instead.">
<figcaption>The <a href="https://codepen.io/cssence/pen/BaXMNyv">accompanying CodePen</a> in ‚ÄúNight Sky‚Äù (top) and ‚ÄúDesert‚Äù (bottom) contrast theme.</figcaption>
</figure>

So do we have an entry-level debugging tool? Well, unless someone goes all the way like we did in the last step of our bad example (highly unlikely!), in Forced Colors Mode you don‚Äôt need to be a developer to recognize real buttons and links. Unless the theme prevents it: Buttons are yellow and regular text is white in the ‚ÄúNight Sky‚Äù theme, but in ‚ÄúDesert‚Äù the difference is way too subtle. No need to stick to the defaults tough, you can create your own theme instead.

## Full disclosure

I didn‚Äôt need to write this article, because common sense exists, right? Then again, there‚Äôs a reason why HTMHell.dev exists. (<abbr title="By the way">BTW</abbr>, thanks for having me, it‚Äôs been an honor to be part of the [2024 Advent Calendar](https://htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2024/) among all those talented people.)

Initially I wrote something else, but it ended up being too long for a calendar entry. _The original article_ is now [available on my blog](https://cssence.com/2024/forced-colors-mode-strategies/). If you are up for **actual Forced Colors Mode advice,** may I suggest you read it, and then consider joining my movement to make December <q cite="https://cssence.com/2024/forced-colors-mode-strategies/">the least colorful time of the year</q>.
