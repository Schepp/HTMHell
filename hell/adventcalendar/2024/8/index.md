Consider the following HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 1996-01//EN">
<html>
  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p class="Author">
    <h1></h1>
    <P>
    <P>
    <H2></H2>
    <P>
    <UL>
      <LI>
      <LI>
      <LI>
    </UL>
    <P>
    <!-- … -->
  </body>
</html>
```

You will notice a few things:

* The unusual doctype
* The inconsistencies in element case (most notably, `<p>` vs. `<P>`)
* The inconsistencies in omitting optional tags (like dropping `</p>` and `</li>` end tags, but keeping `</body>` and `</html>`)

Yet in some respects, this document structure is better than the code we find on many modern websites (and that is sites, not even apps).

Why? What’s to like about this kind of code?

1. _It’s valid._ If you run this and the respective original page’s code through an HTML conformance checker like [the W3C markup validator](https://validator.w3.org/), the code will validate. This is basic _professional_ work [that we don’t see often anymore](https://meiert.com/en/blog/html-conformance-2024/).

2. _It’s focused._ There’s close to no superfluous code. While there’s a little bit more [optional markup](https://meiert.com/en/blog/optional-html/) to be removed, as well as perhaps the `Author` class, one might rather _add_ code, like the style sheet reference that’s conspicuously missing.

3. _It’s… open-minded._ These inconsistencies, they may rub us, and we likely prefer a consistent formatting. But that shouldn’t distract from the fact that the code is valid (which includes uppercase tag names), and that it represents legitimate ways of writing HTML (which in this case means [HTML–HTML, and not XHTML–HTML](https://css-tricks.com/write-html-the-html-way-not-the-xhtml-way/)).

So where is this code from? It’s from [T.V. Raman’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._V._Raman) documentation on [style sheets for spoken renderings](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Speech/speech.html), published on February 12, _1996_. The [1990s](https://frontenddogma.com/topics/1990s/) and [2000s](https://frontenddogma.com/topics/2000s/) are behind us in many areas, and yet in some, they may still be ahead:

We could learn from this code and take it into the future, because XHTML–HTML may have long been dead if it wasn’t kept on eternal life support by frameworks and tools that do not use any of the features that HTML (and that is, don’t mind the repetition, [HTML–HTML](https://css-tricks.com/write-html-the-html-way-not-the-xhtml-way/#aa-the-html-way-of-writing-html)) offers us. The future of HTML—it could embrace more of the HTML of the past.
